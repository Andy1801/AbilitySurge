# **Ability Surge**

Created for _GMTK GameJam 2020_ with the theme "Out Of Control", **Ability Surge** is a game where you play a corrupted robot that has to survive the onslaught of forces 
trying to shut you down. Abilities will rotate quickly and you must learn how to utilize them to your advantage to win. The game is still a work in progress, but you can take a look at some of the assets below as well as the progress made so far. We
([@EShoukry](https://github.com/EShoukry) and [@Andy1801](https://github.com/Andy1801)) do not have much experience with art, so much of the animations, effects, and
level design are not complete yet since we are learning as we create them.
